    "# Q-Learning in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning a simple but important algorithms to learn reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how it works, first let's consider the expected rewards as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} {\\gamma^t r_t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_t$ is a reward value obtained at $t$ and $\\gamma$ is discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when you try to grab an object, you will do the following 3 actions :\n",
    "\n",
    "- action #1 : Stretch your arm ($t=0$)<br>\n",
    "  Getting reward 0.\n",
    "- action #2 : Open your hand ($t=1$)<br>\n",
    "  Getting reward 0.\n",
    "- action #3 : Grab an object ($t=2$)<br>\n",
    "  Getting reward 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you will get a reward value 10 on action #3 ($t=2$), however the action #1 ($t=0$) is obviously contributing to the final rewards. Hence, we consider that the action #1 will have the following expected cumulative reward.<br>\n",
    "Here we assume $\\gamma$ is 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{t=0} = 0 + 0.99 \\times 0 + 0.99^2 \\times 10 = 9.801 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as above, $R_{t=1} = 9.9, R_{t=2} = 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-value is based on this idea of expected cumulative reward. Depending on each state (observation), each action will have the corresponding expected reward.<br>\n",
    "In above example, if you see an object in front of you (i.e, the **state** of \"you see an object\"), the **action** \"stretching your arm\" will have high value of expected reward. However, if you cannot see an object anywhere, the action \"stretching your arm\" will have low value of expected reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-value of each corresponding state and action is denoted as $Q(s, a)$. Suppose both action and state has 1 dimension of discrete values, $Q(s, a)$ will be written as a table (called Q-Table) as follows.<br>\n",
    "If the state is s2, the optimal action to pick up will be action a2. If s3, the optimal action will be action a4.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Q-Table](assets/q-table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, both action space and observation space may have more than 1 dimension. Then Q-Table will be the combination of 1 dimension (action space) and 4 dimension (observation space).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q-Learning, we optimize this table by the following iterative updates ($t=0,1,2,\\ldots$).<br>\n",
    "In the following equation, $ Q_t(s_t,a_t) $ is current Q-value and $ Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t) $ is the updated Q-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t) = Q_t(s_t,a_t) + \\alpha \\left( r_t + \\gamma \\max_a{Q_t(s_{t+1},a)} - Q_t(s_t,a_t) \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation means that :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose, you executed an action $a_t$ on state $s_t$, and as a result, you got reward $r_t$ and the state has changed to $s_{t+1}$.\n",
    "- The optimal next action will satisfy $a_{t+1}=\\max_{a}{Q(s_{t+1},a)}$.<br>\n",
    "  By taking this optimal action, you will then get the expected reward : $r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a}{Q(s_{t+1},a)}$.\n",
    "- Compare this optimal q-value with current q-value $Q(s_t,a_t)$ in q-table. Then update this current value $Q(s_t,a_t)$ by learning rate $\\alpha$.<br>\n",
    "  This will result into above equation.\n",
